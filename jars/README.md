Folder containing jar files. 

The files `eventnet-x.y.jar` are executable jar files for eventnet (for dyadic REM and for RHEM); the files `eventnet-x.y-src.jar` contain source files (`.java` files).

Note that starting from version 1.0, eventnet for dyadic REM and for RHEM is in the same JAR file (`eventnet-1.0.jar` or later). Prior to that version the functionality for dyadic REM and RHEM was in separate jar files. The older versions (`0.x`) are still available in the sub-folder [old_versions-0.x](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/tree/master/jars/old_versions-0.x) for reproducibility, although their use is deprecated.

See the [eventnet wiki](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki) for tutorials, reference guides, and other resources.
