The **Enron email data**, is a collection of email messages among employees of Enron Corporation that has been published after the company filed for bankruptcy in 2001. Here we provide the subset of the data that has been cleaned and processed by Zhou et al. (2007) and which has also been used by Perry and Wolfe (2013). We downloaded the data from [https://github.com/patperry/interaction-proc/tree/master/data/enron](https://github.com/patperry/interaction-proc/tree/master/data/enron) and converted it into the format required for modeling with RHEM via eventnet.
