# "Southern Women Data" from Davis, Gardner and Gardner (DGG)

The so-called "Southern Women Data" (Davis, Gardner, and Gardner, 1941. _Deep South_. The University of Chicago Press) comprises a network of 18 actors participating in 14 time-stamped events and has been used extensively to illustrate social networks methods or theories. This data is ideal to [illustrate relational hyperevent models (RHEM)](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki/RHEM-first-steps-(tutorial)).

The file [DGG.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/master/data/dgg/DGG.csv) is a CSV file (comma-separated values) that first lists the 18 actors and then lists the participants of the 14 events, essentially replicating the information provided in Figure 3 (p.139) of Davis, Gardner, and Gardner (1941) in a different format. The structure of the input data is explained in the [RHEM first steps tutorial](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki/RHEM-first-steps-(tutorial)). The file [dgg.config.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/master/data/dgg/dgg.config.txt) is the configuration file for eventnet.hyper used in that tutorial.

The 15 PDF files listed in [https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/tree/master/data/dgg](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/tree/master/data/dgg) visualize the network in a two-mode representation just before the respective next event takes place. Actors are displayed as circles and event nodes as squares; the participants of the next event are displayed in red. The file [dgg_animation.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/master/data/dgg/dgg_animation.svg) is an animated visualization of the evolving event network (download and open in a web browser to see the animation; the preview in Github does not show any animation). The PDF images and the animation have been created with the visone software [https://visone.ethz.ch/](https://visone.ethz.ch/). The GraphML files (file ending `.graphmlz`) can be opened in visone which allows to compute different layouts or to analyze the networks by different methods. See the visone wiki for exhaustive tutorials.
