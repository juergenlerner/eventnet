# "Southern Women Data" from Davis, Gardner and Gardner (DGG)

The so-called "Southern Women Data" (Davis, Gardner, and Gardner, 1941. _Deep South_. The University of Chicago Press) comprises a network of 18 actors participating in 14 time-stamped events and has been used extensively to illustrate social networks methods or theories. This data is ideal to [illustrate relational hyperevent models (RHEM)](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki/RHEM-first-steps-(tutorial)).

illustrates RHEM by analyzing the DGG data; [lerner_and_lomi_SI.pdf](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/data/dgg/lerner_and_lomi_SI.pdf) is the associated Supporting Information Document.

The file [DGG.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/master/data/dgg/DGG.csv) is a CSV file (comma-separated values) that first lists the 18 actors and then lists the participants of the 14 events, essentially replicating the information provided in Figure 3 (p.139) of Davis, Gardner, and Gardner (1941) in a different format. The structure of the input data is explained in the [RHEM first steps tutorial](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki/RHEM-first-steps-(tutorial)). The file [dgg_actor_names.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/master/data/dgg/dgg_actor_names.txt) is a list of the full names of the 18 actors (one per line) as they are given in Figure 3 of Davis, Gardner, and Gardner (1941), maintaining the order of actors in that figure. The full actor names are given for informational purposes (however, see the "exercises" in the RHEM first steps tutorial). The file [dgg.config.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/master/data/dgg/dgg.config.txt) is the configuration file for eventnet.hyper used in that tutorial.

The 15 PDF files listed in [https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/tree/master/data/dgg](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/tree/master/data/dgg) visualize the network in a two-mode representation just before the respective next event takes place. Actors are displayed as circles and event nodes as squares; the participants of the next event are displayed in red. The file [dgg_animation.svg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/master/data/dgg/dgg_animation.svg) is an animated visualization of the evolving event network (download and open in a web browser to see the animation; the preview in Github does not show any animation). The PDF images and the animation have been created with the visone software [https://visone.ethz.ch/](https://visone.ethz.ch/). The GraphML files (file ending `.graphmlz`) can be opened in visone which allows to compute different layouts or to analyze the networks by different methods. See the visone wiki for exhaustive tutorials.
