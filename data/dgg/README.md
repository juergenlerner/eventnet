# "Southern Women Data" from Davis, Gardner and Gardner (DGG)

The so-called "Southern Women Data" (Davis, Gardner, and Gardner, 1941. _Deep South_. The University of Chicago Press) comprises a network of 18 actors participating in 14 time-stamped events and has been used extensively to illustrate social networks methods or theories. This data is ideal to [illustrate relational hyperevent models (RHEM)](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki/RHEM-first-steps-(tutorial)) with eventnet.hyper.

The file [DGG.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/master/data/dgg/DGG.csv) is a CSV file (comma-separated values) that first lists the 18 actors and then lists the participants of the 14 events, essentially replicating the information provided in Figure 3 (p.139) of Davis, Gardner, and Gardner (1941) in a different format. The structure of the input data is explained in the [RHEM first steps tutorial](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki/RHEM-first-steps-(tutorial)). The file [dgg.config.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/master/data/dgg/dgg.config.txt) is the configuration file for eventnet.hyper used in that tutorial.
