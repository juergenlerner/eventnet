# eventnet
Event network analyzer (eventnet): statistical analysis of networks of relational events.

## Download and use
To use eventnet, download the file [eventnet-0.5.4.jar](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/jars/eventnet-0.5.4.jar) and start the program by double-clicking or via the command `java -jar eventnet-0.5.4.jar`. Eventnet is written in java and needs the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">java runtime environment (JRE)</a>, Java 8 or higher. See the [eventnet wiki](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki) for online tutorials.

**Source code** (```.java``` files) are in [eventnet-0.5.4-src.jar](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/jars/eventnet-0.5.4-src.jar).

## eventnet.hyper (RHEM)
Relational hyperevent models (RHEM) can be analyzed with eventnet.hyper which is an extension of eventnet to events involving any number of actors or nodes, such as meetings, co-authoring, multi-cast communication, or citation networks. To use eventnet.hyper, download the file [eventnet.hyper-0.3.jar](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/jars/eventnet.hyper-0.3.jar). See the [eventnet wiki](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki) for online tutorials.

**Source code** for eventnet.hyper is in [eventnet.hyper-0.3-src.jar](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/jars/eventnet.hyper-0.3-src.jar).
