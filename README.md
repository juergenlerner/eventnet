# eventnet
Event network analyzer (eventnet): statistical analysis of networks of relational events.

## Download and use
To use eventnet, download the file [eventnet-0.5.3.jar](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/jars/eventnet-0.5.3.jar) and start the program by double-clicking or via the command `java -jar eventnet-0.5.3.jar`.

Eventnet is written in java and should run on any computer on which the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">java runtime environment (JRE)</a>, Java 8 or higher, is installed.

**Source code** (```.java``` files) are in [eventnet-0.5.3-src.jar](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/jars/eventnet-0.5.3-src.jar).

## Tutorials and training 
**Online tutorials** for eventnet are in the [eventnet wiki](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki), specifically:

A first introduction to eventnet is provided in the [first-steps tutorial](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki/First-steps-(tutorial)).

More details can be found in the [basic tutorial](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki/Basic-tutorial).

The [tutorial on structural balance](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki/Structural-balance-(tutorial)) specifically demonstrates how to test the predictions of balance theory in networks of positive and negative interaction events. Adding to more basic tutorials, it illustrates two main issues: (1) how to assess the effect of exogenously given covariates (that is, externally defined properties of nodes or dyads) on dyadic interaction and (2) the different possibilities to model interaction events that are typed and/or weighted. 

We further illustrate how to [analyze large event networks](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki/Large-event-networks-(tutorial)), comprising millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of events.
