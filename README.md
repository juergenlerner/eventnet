# eventnet
Event network analyzer (eventnet): statistical analysis of networks of relational events.

## News

Consider attending the following one-day (6 hours) workshop on RHEM at the INSNA Sunbelt Conference
* [**REM beyond dyads: relational hyperevent modeling with eventnet (beginners and advanced)**](https://sunbelt2024.com/), within the _INSNA Sunbelt Conference 2024_, Edinburgh. 24-30 June 2024.

## Download and use (eventnet for dyadic events / REM)
To use eventnet, download the file [eventnet-0.5.6.jar](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/jars/eventnet-0.5.6.jar) and start the program by double-clicking or via the command `java -jar eventnet-0.5.6.jar`. Eventnet is written in java and needs the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">java runtime environment (JRE)</a>, Java 8 (JRE version 1.8) or higher. See the [eventnet wiki](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki) for online tutorials.

**Source code** (```.java``` files) are in [eventnet-0.5.6-src.jar](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/jars/eventnet-0.5.6-src.jar).

## Download and use (eventnet.hyper / RHEM)
Relational hyperevent models (RHEM) can be analyzed with eventnet.hyper which is an extension of eventnet to events involving any number of actors or nodes, such as meetings, co-authoring, multi-cast communication, or citation networks. To use eventnet.hyper, download the file [eventnet.hyper-0.6.jar](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/jars/eventnet.hyper-0.6.jar). See the [eventnet wiki](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki) for online tutorials.

**Source code** for eventnet.hyper is in [eventnet.hyper-0.6-src.jar](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/raw/master/jars/eventnet.hyper-0.6-src.jar).

## References
There is a [commented literature list](https://github.com/juergenlerner/eventnet/wiki/References-(list)) of own work on relational event models (REM) or relational hyperevent models (RHEM), using the eventnet software or (published or unpublished) predecessor software in its empirical analysis. The listed papers are expected to complement the eventnet tutorials in providing more formal details, a better embedding into related work, and a more thorough discussion of objectives and contributions. They may also point to further illustrating use cases of REM and RHEM.
